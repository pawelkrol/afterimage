Instead of explicit validation and error throw, do "require" (this will throw "IllegalArgumentException" instead - wrong argument) or "assert" (this will throw "AssertionError" instead - wrong check in the code) in a class instance

Refactor all exceptions thrown into RuntimeException: there is no need to have so many exception classes, especially for the fact I do not handle them in any specific way.

* Build stand-alone JAR:
  - include dependencies to:
    > scala library jar
    > imagej library jar
  - remove unused classes with ProGuard
* Simplify scripting examples (no longer need to include other dependencies on the classpath!)

* Create dedicated Afterimage website:
  - upload jar to a repo
  - generate scaladoc documentation
  - setup www.attitude.net/afterimage website with some basic info & links (jar, doc, attitude)
  - upload scaladoc to afterimage website
    ncftp> rm -rf scaladoc
    ncftp> put -R scaladoc

* Add support more C64 file formats:
  - http://unusedino.de/ec64/technical/aay/c64/frmmain.htm
  - http://codebase64.org/doku.php?id=base:c64_grafix_files_specs_list_v0.03

* Add new class: Selection (which can be manipulated -> translate/move within a current image)
