* Conversion from ArtStudio to HiResBitmap doesn't work, because selected pixel/background colours
  may flip between chars. In order to fix it, importing HiResBitmap data should take it into account
  and fix set/clear pixels accordingly.
* Importing HiResBitmap from PNG/JPG also doesn't work, because for each 8x8 char the most frequent
  colour is selected as a background completely independently from the rest of the picture. Instead
  it should have been first determined globally and applied with the same colour scheme to every 8x8
  char.

* Build stand-alone JAR:
  - include dependencies to:
    > scala library jar
    > imagej library jar
  - remove unused classes with ProGuard
* Simplify scripting examples (no longer need to include other dependencies on the classpath!)

* Create dedicated Afterimage website:
  - upload jar to a repo
  - generate scaladoc documentation
  - setup www.attitude.net/afterimage website with some basic info & links (jar, doc, attitude)
  - upload scaladoc to afterimage website
    ncftp> rm -rf scaladoc
    ncftp> put -R scaladoc

* Add support more C64 file formats:
  - http://unusedino.de/ec64/technical/aay/c64/frmmain.htm
  - http://codebase64.org/doku.php?id=base:c64_grafix_files_specs_list_v0.03

* Add new class: Selection (which can be manipulated -> translate/move within a current image)

* Useful info about creating stand-alone executable JARs:
